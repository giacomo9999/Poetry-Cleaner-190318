  "It was many and many a year ago ZZZ In a kingdom by the sea ZZZ That a maiden there lived whom you may know ZZZ By the name of Annabel Lee ZZZ And this maiden she lived with no other thought ZZZ Than to love and be loved by me ZZZ I was a child and she was a child ZZZ In this kingdom by the sea ZZZ But we loved with a love that was more than love ZZZ I and my Annabel Lee ZZZ With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven ZZZ Coveted her and me ZZZ And this was the reason that, long ago ZZZ In this kingdom by the sea ZZZ A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling ZZZ My beautiful Annabel Lee ZZZ So that her highborn kinsmen came ZZZ And bore her away from me ZZZ To shut her up in a sepulchre ZZZ In this kingdom by the sea ZZZ The angels, not half so happy in Heaven ZZZ Went envying her and me ZZZ Yes that was the reason (as all men know ZZZ In this kingdom by the sea ZZZ That the wind came out of the cloud by night ZZZ Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee ZZZ But our love it was stronger by far than the love ZZZ Of those who were older than we ZZZ Of many far wiser than we ZZZ And neither the angels in Heaven above ZZZ Nor the demons down under the sea ZZZ Can ever dissever my soul from the soul ZZZ Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ZZZ For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams  ZZZ Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ZZZ And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes ZZZ Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ZZZ And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side ZZZ Of my darling— my darling— my life and my bride ZZZ In her sepulchre there by the sea ZZZ In her tomb by the sounding sea ZZZ";
