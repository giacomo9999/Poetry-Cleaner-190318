//   "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door 'Tis some visiter,  I muttered, tapping at my chamber door —Only this and nothing more Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow; — vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating ’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; This it is and nothing more Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, Sir, said I, or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you — here I opened wide the door; ——Darkness there and nothing more Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, Lenore This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, Lenore! Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. Surely, said I, surely that is something at my window lattice Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore Tis the wind and nothing more Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched, and sat, and nothing more Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, I said, art sure no craven Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore! Quoth the Raven Nevermore Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly Though its answer little meaning — little relevancy bore For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door With such name as Nevermore But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour Nothing farther then he uttered — not a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before. Then the bird said Nevermore. Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken Doubtless, said I, what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of Never — nevermore But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking Nevermore This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp - light gloated o’er But whose velvet - violet lining with the lamp - light gloating o’er She shall press, ah, nevermore! Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by seraphim whose foot - falls tinkled on the tufted floor Wretch, I cried, “thy God hath lent thee — by these angels he hath sent thee Respite — respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore! Quoth the Raven   Nevermore. Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! — prophet still, if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted — tell me truly, I implore Is there — is there balm in Gilead ?— tell me — tell me, I implore! Quoth the Raven Nevermore. Prophet! said I, “thing of evil! — prophet still, if bird or devil By that Heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Quoth the Raven Nevermore Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbroken! — quit the bust above my door Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming And the lamp - light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted — nevermore!";


const poem = "By a route obscure and lonely Haunted by ill angels only Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT On a black throne reigns upright, I have reached these lands but newly   From an ultimate dim Thule— From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime, Out of SPACE—Out of TIME. Bottomless vales and boundless floods,   And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,   With forms that no man can discover   For the tears that drip all over;   Mountains toppling evermore   Into seas without a shore;   Seas that restlessly aspire,   Surging, unto skies of fire;   Lakes that endlessly outspread   Their lone waters— lone and dead,— Their still waters— still and chilly   With the snows of the lolling lily. By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters, lone and dead,— Their sad waters, sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily,— By the mountains—near the river   Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,—   By the grey woods by the swamp   Where the toad and the newt encamp,—   By the dismal tarns and pools Where dwell the Ghouls,—   By each spot the most unholy—   In each nook most melancholy,—   There the traveller meets, aghast,   Sheeted Memories of the Past—   Shrouded forms that start and sigh   As they pass the wanderer by—    white robed forms of friends long given,   In agony, to the Earth—and Heaven. For the heart whose woes are legion   ’Tis a peaceful, soothing region—   For the spirit that walks in shadow   ’Tis—oh, ’tis an Eldorado! But the traveller, travelling through it,   May not— dare not openly view it;   Never its mysteries are exposed   To the weak human eye unclosed;   So wills its King, who hath forbid   The uplifting of the fringed lid;   And thus the sad Soul that here passes   Beholds it but through darkened glasses. By a route obscure and lonely,   Haunted by ill angels only, Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT, On a black throne reigns upright,   I have wandered home but newly   From this ultimate dim Thule."
